## Starting from initial PDB (named initial.pdb) sturture given by cgNA+min 
## first redo the pdb file using tleap -- this will reindex bases from 1 .. N
## Then simply run the leap_initial_str.sh to get the final structure ...
## the leap_initial_str.sh script does the following steps
## a) reindex bases from 1 .. N
## b) Close the minicircle by forming bonds between terminal bases
## c) add water
## d) Add ions to neutralize and then corresponding to 0.15M KCl

##  Check leap.log and visualize the final structre using VMD or any viewer
